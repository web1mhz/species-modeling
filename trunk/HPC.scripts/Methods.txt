Occurrences
- files downloaded from GBIF on ???
- cleaning was done by CIAT
- species were assigned unique identifiers
	- analysis was to species level with info on subspecies, etc. ignored
- files were provided to JJV on 2010-04-17

background
- files were supplied shortly after UK meeting
- JJV used the backselection.asc to select random background points from
- the globe was broken up into 6 unique domains...
	- 1 .. North America incl. Greenland
	- 2 .. Latin America
	- 3 .. Europe incl. Russia
	- 4 .. Asia
	- 5 .. Africa
	- 6 .. Australia and New Zealand
- 10,000 random background points were assumed to represent the each domain
- only background points from the domains in which the species occurred were used in training the models
	- thus species in multiple domains would have number of domains * 10000 background points

Algorithm
- Maxent was used. version 3.3.2
